# Porcupine
## PORcupine Creates Ur PipelINE
## Compilation
This is a pipeline program for which documentation might be added some time in the future. For now, it should readily compile on any platform with <a href="https://www.qt.io/download/">Qt Creator</a>. Once that works, the GUI should be quite self-explanatory.

Currently, it's been tested on Mac, Windows and Linux with the latest version of Qt (5.7.0) and Qt Creator (4.1.0). If that's installed, basically pressing the big green button is the only thing you need to make it compile and run.

Installer files will be provided in the near future.

## Modules
Porcupine features interfaces to
* My own fMRI analysis toolbox, including laminar fMRI https://github.com/TimVanMourik/OpenFmriAnalysis
* NiPype https://github.com/nipy/nipype
